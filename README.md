 <h1>Rust Vulnerability Scanner</h1>
    <p>This Rust code is a simple vulnerability scanner that checks if a given URL is secure by verifying if it uses HTTPS and if its SSL certificate is valid.</p>
    <p>The code uses the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/reqwest" target="_blank">reqwest</a> and <a href="https://crates.io/crates/url" target="_blank">url</a> crates for making HTTP requests and parsing URLs respectively.</p>
    <p>It also employs the <a href="https://docs.rs/reqwest/latest/reqwest/redirect/enum.Policy.html" target="_blank">reqwest redirect policy</a> to disable automatic redirections and ensures that the URL remains unchanged during the request.</p>
